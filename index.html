    <h1>🌭Croissant Origins</h1>
    <p>
      “Croissant” comes from the word for “crescent”, as in a “crescent moon”.
      This describes the pastry created from rolling and folding buttery dough
      over and over into a thin sheet that is then cut and rolled into its
      iconic shape, which fully forms as it bakes into a tempting golden brown.

        There is evidence that it all began when August Zang, an Austrian artillery officer, opened the Boulangerie Viennoise on Richelieu Street in Paris. It is said that his Viennese breads and baked goods were so famous that he inspired the French bakers to imitate his crescent-shaped breads, which turned into the world-famous croissant we know today.
