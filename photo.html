    <h1>What makes a great croissant</h1>
    <p>
      “What makes a good croissant is the contrast between the crunchiness of
      its crust and the soft, airy feel of its insides, with a good buttery
      taste,” explains Tournemolle, who reaped his rewards from hours of
      inventive baking and dessert making at such famous French restaurants as
      Le Laurent (One MICHELIN Star, MICHELIN Guide Paris), Le Bristol Paris,
      Baumanière and Le Prieuré.
